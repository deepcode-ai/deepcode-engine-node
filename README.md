## Usage

### Running a codemod

    deepcode [framework/version/codemod-name]

#### Example (running Next.js app router receipe codemod)

### List available codemods

The `list` command can be used to list all codemods available in the [Deepcode Registry](https://github.com/deepcode-ai/codemod-registry).

### Sync registry

The `syncRegistry` command can be used to sync local codemods with the public [Deepcode Registry](https://github.com/deepcode-ai/codemod-registry).

    deepcode syncRegistry

### Generate codemod from file diff

The `learn` command can be used to send the diff of the latest edited file to Deepcode Studio and have it automatically build an explainable and debuggable codemod.

After running this command, if any git diff exists, Deepcode will use the diff as before/after snippets in [Deepcode Studio](https://codemod.studio).
